## A synth from scratch

This is an experimental project aimed at playing with sound generation. The
original goal was to write an approximate software emulation of the Roland
[Juno-60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60) synthesizer, but as the
project progressed, it took on a life of its own and became much more open
ended.

## Play project

This project is a ‚Äúplay project‚Äù: sound generation is a brand new domain to me,
I‚Äôve last worked with C in uni in 2005, so I have no hopes of a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù
outcome ‚Äî only of exploring and enjoying the process.
